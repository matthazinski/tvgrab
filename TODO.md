## Upcoming Features
The following features are slated for future releases:
- Plex/XBMC integration - trigger library updates after files are added
- "cleanup" mode - re-sort local downloads directory (e.g. in case you added a new series to your config)
- log all adds to a file


## Potential Features
These would be nice to have but I likely won't be implementing them myself
- Support for Deluge
- Protocols other than rsync daemon (e.g. rsync over ssh, http, udr)
